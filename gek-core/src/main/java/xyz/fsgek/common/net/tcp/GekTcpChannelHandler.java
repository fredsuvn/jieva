     * Server has a list of handlers,
     * the first handler will be passed a {@link ByteBuffer} as {@code message} parameter,
     * then returned object from first handler will be passed to next handler as {@code message} parameter, and so on.
     * If null is returned from any handler, the handlers calling chain will be broken at that handler;
     * if an exception is thrown, {@link GekTcpServerHandler#onException(GekTcpChannel, Throwable, ByteBuffer)} will be called
     * and the calling chain will also be broken. The process like:
     * <pre>
     *     Object message = ByteBuffer.wrap(...);
     *     for (FsNetChannelHandler&lt;...&gt; channelHandler : channelHandlers) {
     *         try {
     *             Object result = channelHandler.onMessage(channel, message);
     *             if (result == null) {
     *                 break;
     *             }
     *             message = result;
     *         } catch (Throwable e) {
     *             serverHandler.onException(channel, e, remaining);
     *             break;
     *         }
     *     }
     * </pre>
     * If buffer of the channel is full, it will not read and put again.
     * If the buffer on this callback is not fully consumed (remaining() &gt; 0), the remaining data will be
     * reserved to next calling. However, the handler chain will be called if and only if there has new data read from
     * the remote endpoint. It's best to try to consume as much as possible for each time,
     * or using {@link GekTcpServerHandler#onLoop(GekTcpChannel, boolean, ByteBuffer)} to deal with un-consumed data.
     *
     * @param channel the channel
     * @param message the message
     * @return result of callback
